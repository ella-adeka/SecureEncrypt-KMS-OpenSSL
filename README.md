# SecureEncrypt-KMS-OpenSSL

This project involves seamless integration of AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and OpenSSL for secure encryption and decryption of sensitive data. The project demonstrates how to leverage the power of cloud-based key management alongside robust open-source cryptography tools to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. By combining these technologies, the project provides a reliable and scalable solution for safeguarding data in transit and at rest.
